**Project Description**
-
- This research paper uncovers the practical application and comparison of three computer vision modelsá…³ Feedforward Neural Network (FFN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Vision Transformer (ViT). While these methods are widely established, our goal is to derive measurable insights and best practices by comparing these three unique models, especially towards tackling both binary and multi-class classification challenges in facial recognition. Our study not only compares classical deep learning alongside cutting-edge methods, but aims to uncover significant evaluative metrics such as neural network architecture, model accuracy, training loss, and overall efficiency. Our results uncover numerous ways to help inform future research and practical applications across computer vision challenges. We find that both CNN and ViT outperform FFNs, and also highlight the importance of having a well balanced dataset to train from where all the groups are well represented.
